Training Takeaways: Secure LLMs, Agentic AI & AI-Powered Java Applications

1. Building Secure LLMs (Large Language Models):

Data Security: Emphasize proper data sanitization and encryption throughout the pipeline—especially during data ingestion and storage.

Access Control: Implement strict access policies for LLM models, APIs, and inference endpoints.

Prompt Injection Defense: Use input validation, context separation, and guardrails to protect against prompt injection attacks.

Auditability: Ensure logging and monitoring are in place to track model usage, anomalies, and abuse patterns.

Ethical Safeguards: Integrate content filters, bias mitigation strategies, and explainability tools.


2. Developing Agentic AI Systems:

Autonomy with Oversight: Build agents that act autonomously but remain aligned with human objectives via continuous feedback loops.

Modular Architecture: Use composable tools like planners, memory modules, and tool interfaces for scalable design.

State Management: Implement persistent and contextual memory systems for long-term agent reasoning.

Security Controls: Prevent agents from taking harmful actions by enforcing constraints and validation at decision points.


3. AI-Powered Application Development with Java:

Framework Integration: Leverage Java ML libraries (e.g., Deep Java Library, Tribuo) or call Python models using JNI or REST APIs.

Microservices Architecture: Deploy AI functionalities as modular, secure microservices for scalability and maintainability.

Data Pipeline Handling: Use Java for robust ETL pipelines to prepare and manage input data for AI models.

Inference Management: Optimize model inference with caching, batching, and concurrency control in Java applications.

Monitoring & Logging: Use tools like Micrometer and Prometheus for observability of AI features in production.
